   - Subject line: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Omega-PHR`
   - Include detailed information about the vulnerability

2. **Private Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
   - Go to the Security tab of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the vulnerability details

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Affected versions**: Which versions of Omega-PHR are affected
- **Proposed fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue
- **Contact information**: How we can reach you for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on responsible disclosure

### Security Update Process

2. **Impact Assessment**: We assess the severity and impact
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Security Advisory**: We prepare a security advisory
5. **Release**: We release the fix and publish the advisory
6. **Notification**: We notify users about the security update

## Security Best Practices

When using Omega-PHR, please follow these security best practices:

### Authentication & Authorization

- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens
- Follow the principle of least privilege for user permissions

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest
- Regularly backup your data and test restoration procedures
- Implement proper access controls for sensitive information
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Regularly update network security configurations
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### System Security

- Keep Omega-PHR and all dependencies up to date
- Regularly apply security patches
- Use secure configuration settings
- Implement logging and monitoring for security events

### Development Security

- Follow secure coding practices
- Conduct regular security code reviews
- Use static analysis tools for vulnerability detection
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We believe in responsible disclosure and ask that security researchers:

1. **Give us reasonable time** to address vulnerabilities before public disclosure
2. **Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting** user data
3. **Do not perform attacks** that could harm the availability of our services
4. **Do not access data** that doesn't belong to you
5. **Report vulnerabilities** as soon as possible after discovery

## Security Contacts

- **Primary Contact**: Chandu Chitikam ([chandu@portalvii.com](mailto:chandu@portalvii.com))
- **Alternative**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub

## Recognition

We appreciate the security research community's efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.
Researchers who report valid security vulnerabilities will be:

- Acknowledged in our security advisories (if desired)
- Listed in our hall of fame (with permission)
- Kept informed throughout the remediation process

## Security Tools and Monitoring

We use various tools and practices to maintain security:

- **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Dependencies are regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities
- **Automated Testing**: Security tests are included in our CI/CD pipeline
- **Monitoring**: We monitor for security incidents and anomalies

## Compliance and Standards

Omega-PHR aims to comply with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Following OWASP security guidelines
- **NIST Framework**: Implementing NIST cybersecurity framework principles
- **Industry Standards**: Adhering to relevant industry security standards
