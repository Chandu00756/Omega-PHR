# Code of Conduct

## My Commitment

As the sole developer and researcher for Omega PHR, I am committed to maintaining a respectful, ethical, and
responsible environment for my work. I pledge to conduct myself with integrity and professionalism in all aspects
of this project.

I pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy research community focused on advancing AI security.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
research community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other researchers
* Being respectful of differing research opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback on research work
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall research community and advancement of AI security

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' research or private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Misrepresenting research findings or fabricating data
* Using the framework for malicious purposes outside of authorized research
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  research or academic setting

## Research Ethics

Given the sensitive nature of AI security research, all contributors must:

* Use the framework only for legitimate research purposes
* Obtain proper authorization before testing on systems you do not own
* Respect privacy and confidentiality of any data encountered during research
* Follow responsible disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities discovered
* Ensure research activities comply with applicable laws and regulations
* Document and share findings responsibly within the research community

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Research community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful to the research community.

Research community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all research spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the research community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline research event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the research community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
promptly and fairly.

All research community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security
of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Research community leaders will follow these Research Community Impact Guidelines
in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this
Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Research Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior
deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the research community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from research community leaders,
providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why
the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Research Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions that negatively impact the research environment.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in research spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban from research activities.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Research Community Impact**: A serious violation of research community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or misuse of research tools.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the research community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban from research activities.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Research Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of research
community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals,
or serious misuse of research tools for malicious purposes.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the research community.
